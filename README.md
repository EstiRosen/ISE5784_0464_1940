**3D Image Rendering Platform**

This Java-based platform was developed as part of an Introduction to Software Engineering course at Jerusalem College of Technology (May 2024 â€“ July 2024). It enables users to generate 3D images through vector manipulation, color processing, and simulating realistic lighting effects. The project demonstrates fundamental principles of 3D rendering such as camera integration, lighting effects, and reflections.

**Features:**
3D Image Generation: Create dynamic 3D scenes with custom objects using vector-based geometry.
Camera Integration: Simulates various camera angles and perspectives for realistic scene viewing.
Lighting Effects: Supports multiple light sources and simulates shadows, brightness, and reflections.
Color Processing: Enables color customization for objects and lighting to achieve visually appealing scenes.
Reflections & Transparency: Adds realism through object reflections and transparent surfaces.

**Technologies:**
Java: Core language for development.
Vector Manipulation: For defining object coordinates and scene geometry.
Color Processing: For managing color attributes and applying lighting effects.
Object-Oriented Design: Ensures scalability and maintainability of the platform.
